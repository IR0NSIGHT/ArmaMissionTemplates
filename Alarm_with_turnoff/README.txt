# alarm sound with turn off
- trigger activates the alarm sound. you can edit that conditions under which the trigger will activate
- alarm runs for 300 seconds (countdown variable in init field), then automatically turns off.
- the alarm will only activate ONCE, it can not be reactivated after it was triggered, was turned off etc.
- the alarm can not run, if the turn-off was used earlier 

## deactivating the alarm by computer
- the synced rugged computer has a holdaction, usable by anyone to deactivate the alarm.
- you can copy paste the computer and sync it to the trigger to create more than one hold-action-objects (multple turn off points)
- you can change the type of the computer, just dont edit the hold action.

## deactivating the alarm by destroying the power
next to the alarm post is a generator. it will also disable the alarm when its damaged beyond 99%.
in theory the generator can be any type of object, but in tests i found that this one can be killed with 2 magazines of 5.56 and other models are very hard to kill (even with HEAT m136)

the generator can be copy pasted too, just need to sync it to the trigger.

## general
the position of the computer and generator does matter, only that they are synced to the trigger.

## additional:
- only relevant obejcts in this composition are the trigger object.
- you can delete the computer and/or the generator, does not matter
- you can spawn in as many compositions as you want, they do not care about each other.
